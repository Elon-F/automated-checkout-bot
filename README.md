Automated checkout script for when manually going through the process just plain isn't fast enough. 

Takes care of log-in, monitoring for availability, adding to cart, and completing the checkout process. Handles the most common errors i ran into.  

### Background 

During the great pandemic of the 2020's, some consumer goods experienced a significant surge in demand which resulted in significant difficulties purchasing them.
This script was created at the request of a friend who had trouble ordering such a product from a website, and needed an automated solution.
The bulk of the work was done in a single afternoon to try and make the expected restock window.
